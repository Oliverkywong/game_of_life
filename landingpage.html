            The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.<br>
         It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.<br>
         One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. <br>
         It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.
